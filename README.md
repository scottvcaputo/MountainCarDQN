    - Model can be tested and visualized using pre-trained weights


## Inspiration

- After completing several courses and specializations in machine learning and deep learning, I was interested in applying these concepts to better understand all that goes into the implementation of a model. I found much of the information across the web to primiarily be done in older framework versions like Tensorflow 1 and Keras. Being that I wanted to create a future for myself in the field, I was more interested in the most recent framekwork versions and chose to dedicate my time to Tensorflow 2 and Pytorch.

- This model was written in Python using the Tensorflow 2 framework, with Tensorflow-Keras as the backend API, which was incorporated to build the DQN neural network.
